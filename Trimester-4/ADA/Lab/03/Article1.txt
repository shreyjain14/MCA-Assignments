'Operation Sindoor called, and we delivered': Gautam Adani on Adani Defence’s role in India’s counterstrike

Gautam Adani announced on Tuesday that the drones and anti-drone systems manufactured by his company were crucial in Operation Sindoor. This operation was a counter-terror strike by the Indian Armed Forces in response to the Pahalgam terror attack.

Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting, Adani stated, "Operation Sindoor called, and we delivered."

According to Adani, the loitering munitions made by Adani Defence carried out precise strikes, while their counter-drone units protected Indian assets from potential retaliatory actions.
