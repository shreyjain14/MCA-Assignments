Solar Aerospace's Night Drones Order
Indian firm gets army contract for loitering munitions after Sindoor success:


Nagpur: After Nagastra 1 — the loitering munition that was used during Operation Sindoor — Nagpur's Solar Aerospace and Defence Limited (SADL) has bagged an order for the advanced version of the system, Nagastra-1R, that's capable of night operations too.
The company signed an agreement to supply 450 Nagastra-1R to the Army within one year. This new system is equipped with a thermal camera for night operations apart from a 360 degree gimbal camera. The system has proprietary encryption for video and telemetry communication along with a high-precision targeting system. More than 80% of its components are indigenous, said a note shared with TOI.
The system was tested at different locations, including Ladakh for cold weather trials, and Babina near Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. Loitering munitions are drone-based systems. The drones carry the bombs as payloads, which are dropped after zeroing in on the target. As it hovers around until the target is fixed, it gets the name loitering munitions.
The Nagastra-1R also has full re-usability of the launcher systems, said sources. SADL is also developing the Nagastra 2 and Nagastra 3 versions, which have a higher range and can carry a heavier payload.
